# Runner

The BHAA runner uses the __wp_user__ data and has custom meta data fields

## Meta Data Fields

The custom bhaa meta fields are

* bhaa_runner_firstname
* bhaa_runner_lastname
* bhaa_runner_standard
* bhaa_runner_status
* bhaa_runner_dateofbirth
* bhaa_runner_mobilephone
* bhaa_runner_dateofrenewal;

# User Data
- metadata fields store the name value pairs below
- p2p is used to link a runner to a house (aka company/sector team).

## Edit Runner Pages

An admin user can edit all the meta-fields for a runner.

The main scenario is to update the membership status, standard and correct a spelling mistake in the name.
